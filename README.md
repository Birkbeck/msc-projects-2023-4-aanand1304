Project Structure
Data_Preparation:

ExploratoryDataAnalysis: Likely contains scripts or notebooks for initial data exploration.
Twitter, hackmageddon, monthly_Mentiondata, other features: These may hold specific datasets or feature extraction scripts.
python_holidy.py: A script, possibly for integrating holiday effects in the data.
Dataset:

FinalDataset.csv: The primary dataset used for model training and evaluation.
Model:

modelfinding: May include model selection scripts.
multivariate_Forecast.ipynb and univariate_Forecast.ipynb: Notebooks for forecasting using multivariate and univariate models, respectively.
multivariate_hp_optimisation.ipynb and univariate_hp_optimisation.ipynb: Notebooks focused on hyperparameter optimization for the models.
SHAP_Plot:

Contains various SHAP plots (e.g., Advance.png, Malvertising-ALL.png) that visualize feature importance for different attack types or model predictions.
Validation_plot_univariate_multivariate:

multiVariateplot and univariateplot: Directories that likely contain validation plots, showing how the model performs on different metrics for multivariate and univariate models.
hyperparameters_univariate_multivariate:

multivariate and univariate folders may include configurations or details about the hyperparameters used for each type of model.
prediction_plot_univariate_multivariate:

multivariate_forecast_plot and univariate_forecast_plot: Plots visualizing predictions from the respective models.
other plot: Potentially additional plots showcasing different aspects of model predictions.
