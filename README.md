**Project Structure**
**1. Data_Preparation**
Contains scripts and files for data cleaning, feature extraction, and preparation for model training. Key files include:

ExploratoryDataAnalysis: Scripts for initial data exploration, visualizations, and data summaries.
Twitter, hackmageddon, monthly_Mentiondata, other features: Feature extraction methods or additional data sources.
python_holidy.py: Adds holiday-related data, potentially to adjust for seasonal or holiday effects.

**2. Dataset****
FinalDataset.csv: The main dataset used for model training and evaluation. Includes details on features, target variable, and any pre-processing steps required.

**3. Model**
Notebooks and scripts related to model training and hyperparameter optimization:

modelfinding: Scripts for model selection.
multivariate_Forecast.ipynb: Notebook for multivariate forecasting.
univariate_Forecast.ipynb: Notebook for univariate forecasting.
multivariate_hp_optimisation.ipynb: Hyperparameter optimization for multivariate models.
univariate_hp_optimisation.ipynb: Hyperparameter optimization for univariate models.

**4. SHAP_Plot**
Contains SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots to visualize feature importance for various model predictions:

Advance.png, Advare.png, Backdoor-ALL.png, etc.: SHAP plots by category (e.g., Malware, Phishing), showing feature impact on predictions.

**5. Validation_plot_univariate_multivariate**
Validation plots for model performance evaluation:

multiVariateplot: Validation results for multivariate model predictions.
univariateplot: Validation results for univariate model predictions.

**6. hyperparameters_univariate_multivariate**
Documents hyperparameters for each model:

multivariate: Hyperparameter configurations for multivariate models.
univariate: Hyperparameter configurations for univariate models.

**7. prediction_plot_univariate_multivariate**
Prediction visualizations:

multivariate_forecast_plot: Forecast plots for multivariate models.
univariate_forecast_plot: Forecast plots for univariate models.
other plot: Additional prediction plots.
